# This will use BASH commands like "grep" to find search criteria within files.
# HOWEVER!
# The person who codes this will need to make sure that "grep" is run in the background
# (meaning the user is NOT allowed to see the output from the grep results), and
# parse the data returned from grep themselves IN the script and check THAT against
# permissions.sh and return ONLY what the user is allowed to see based on that.
