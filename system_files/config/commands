# This file will contain absolutely nothing but a list of available commmands,
# and what BASH command they will execute if they pass the permissions check.

# Bashuntu Command 	| Ubuntu Command
list								| ls
mkfile							| touch

# For explanation purposes, this is how it will work, but in actuality, it will
# look something more like this:

list ls
mkfile touch

# That's it. No extra characters, just a space. No tabs, no comment '#' markers,
# nothing. It'll make the file easier to parse.
